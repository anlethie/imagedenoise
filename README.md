Low-light photography is always challenging because of noise. Usually, cameras will
take photos with high ISO sensitivity to compensate low brightness, but at the same time amplify noise
signal. Photographers can also keep ISO low by increasing exposure time or aperture, however, result
photos can be blur due to motion or depth of field. Therefore, many post-processing methods have been
developed to restore original quality of noised imaging, and this has been an active area of research for
years. In recent years, researchers in convolution neural network and deep learning have proposed
many successful deep learning methods to denoise photos. Our project aims to explore denoising
problem and propose a pipeline based on materials presented in CS 175 project course at UCI. Using
presented dataset, our network learns and processes directly on RGB images with real life noise and
produce restored images. We evaluate and compare our method to BM3D[4] method.
